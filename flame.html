    <p class="f">Phoebe is voiced by Jessica DiCicco. Flame Princess,
      whose name is Phoebe and who is occasionally called FP, is the current
      ruler of the Fire Kingdom as well as Finn's ex-girlfriend.
      When Jake asks Flambo if he knows any princesses that are Finn's
      age so he can fix his broken heart, he introduces Jake to Flame Princess.</p>
